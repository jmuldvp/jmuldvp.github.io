I'm testing out a blog site idea on GitHub.

While I've taken an online class about web development, I'm a Business Intelligence Developer by trade. I plan on using this as a way to keep notes and maybe it might help others as well that may be in both realms.

I once blogged about how I setup a Ubuntu virtual machine to do something specific, 4-5 years later I googled about the same topic.  My own blog post came up (that I apparently forgot about) and it helped me perform the same setup.  As I'm reading the post, I was wondering why it looked so familiar.  =P
