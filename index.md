I'm testing out a blog site idea on GitHub.

While I've taken an online class about web development, I'm a business intelligence developer by trade. I plan on using this as a way to keep notes on things I do in both realms. I'm hoping these notes/posts might help me in the future or others.

I once blogged about how I setup a Ubuntu virtual machine to do something specific, 4-5 years later I googled about the same topic.  My own blog post came up (that I apparently forgot about) and it helped me perform the same setup.  As I'm reading the post, I was wondering why it looked so familiar.  =P

I'm going to try and stray away from longer posts and make the content I post more bite sized.
